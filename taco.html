    <h1><em>Homemade taco seasoning</em></h1>

    <p>Making taco seasoning from scratch is super easy and can be cheaper than buying the prepared taco seasoning. 
        Here are the spices I include in my recipe. 
        Feel free to also add paprika, coriander, onion powder and crushed red pepper to give it some heat.

        <ul>
            <Li>Chili powder</Li>
            
            <Li>Cumin</Li>
            
            <Li>Garlic powder</Li>
            
            <Li>Mexican oregano</Li>

            <Li>Salt and pepper</Li>

        </ul>
